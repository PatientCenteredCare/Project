    <p class ="AmandaIntro">This is all about Amanda</p>
    <p class ="KatieInto">Katie graduated from Purdue University with a BSIE and was commissioned into the United States Air Force.  She served 5.5 years on active duty with assignments as an intelligence officer and systems engineer.  Her personal experience with medical error prompted her not only to volunteer as a patient advisor but also to redirect her career into engineering for healthcare.  She currently serves in the Air Force Reserve as a healthcare systems engineer.  Katie is in the Purdue MSIE program concentrating on human factors in healthcare.   Her thesis work investigates nursing handoffs and their effect on nursing care.</p>
